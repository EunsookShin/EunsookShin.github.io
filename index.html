				<p>On a national level, we are tossing out food that is worth over $218 Billion due to food waste, yet millions of people are still going to bed hungry. Is there a better way to distribute food supply?<br><br>

				Sharing a common interest in food waste and sustainability, I have worked with two other CS students in developing a startup idea to develop a mobile app platform that would facilitate the distribution of surplus food from restaurants to those in need, saving both the environment and money.<br><br>

				My team and I participated in <a href="https://viterbiinnovation.usc.edu/mfc/">Min Family Challenge</a> and <a href="https://viterbiinnovation.usc.edu/abc/">ABC Innovation</a> Competitions at USC, where we closely worked with professional entrepreneurs and experienced mentors who would provide us with resources and advice on customer discovery and business models. With the help of these people and my diligent teammates, we were able to win $1000 for funding from ABC challenge, which we plan to use to further develop our application.<br><br>

				Extending our passion in developing technology to meet pressing societal needs, my team and I hope to develop a community where both sustainability and food security are encouraged.</p><br><br>

				<h1>MoodSic</h1>
				<h2>HackSC 2020</h2><br><br>

				<div class="image"><img src="assets/img/portfolio/HackSC.JPG"></div><br><br>

				<p>The inspiration for this project came from algorithms on music streaming platforms. Spotify and Apple Music both utilize algorithms that recommend playlists that have a certain mood or emotion associated with the songs, and we wanted to mimic this algorithm without a person to individually tag all the songs.<br><br>

				The algorithm uses a spectrogram to analyze the frequency and amplitude of audio input and output a categorization of the song as one of three moods: happy, sad, and calm.We used spectrogram.py library to convert audio wav files to spectrogram images. Then, we passed in a dataset of 100 songs labeled as either happy, calm, or sad. Using Google Cloud AutoML, the trained model predicts the mood of new song input based on a comparison between its spectrogram image and the training dataset.</p><br><br>

				<h1>Smart Meal Planner</h1>
				<h2>ITP 303: Full Stack Web Development</h2><br>

				<div class="image"><img src="assets/img/portfolio/3.jpg"></div><br>

				<p>College students often find it difficult to plan meals in between their busy schedules. In the beginning of the semester, when I was overloaded with course work, career events, and research lab, I often skipped breakfast and lunch, finally managing to eat my first meal at 9pm. I wanted to solve such a problem by developing a scheduler that will keep track of my meals each week. Basically, my project allows logged in users to add a menu to their calendars. Additionally, users can view/edit/delete menu items from the calendar.</p><br>

				<h1>Dining Hall Menu Alert</h1>
				<h2>AthenaHacks 2019</h2><br>

				<div class="image"><img src="assets/img/portfolio/4.jpg"></div><br>

				<p>We have a limited number of dining swipes per semester, and we wanted to eat at the dining halls only when the menu had food that we wanted to eat, so that we wouldn't be wasting our dining swipes on food we don't even want to eat. Because we are busy college students and looking up the menu and checking if it had our favorite foods is a waste of time, so we decided to create a program that alerted us whenever the dining halls had food we like on the menu.<br><br>

				The Dining Hall Alert notifies students via email whenever the dining hall has one of their favorite foods on the menu for that day.<br><br>

				We created a user interface using tkinter from Python, and this user interface allows students to enter their favorite foods as well as their email to alert whenever the dining hall served those foods. We used the BeautifulSoup Python package to parse through the online menu for the dining halls and check whether or not the menu had the student's favorite food for the day. Then, we created a web server that allowed emails to be sent to the student whenever the menu included one of the student's favorite foods.</p><br>
